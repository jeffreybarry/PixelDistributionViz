# PixelDistributionViz ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š

PixelDistributionViz is an interactive educational tool that visualizes pixel-level data from images. It allows users to hover over an image to see the RGB values of individual pixels and displays histograms to show the distribution of these values. This project is designed to help explain how data distributions work in the context of diffusion models and image processing.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Interactive Image Viewer:**  
  Hover over any pixel in the image to instantly view its Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha values.

- **Histogram Visualization:**  
  View the distribution of pixel values across the red, green, and blue channels using dynamically generated histograms.

- **Educational Insights:**  
  Gain a better understanding of how pixel data forms the basis of diffusion models and other image processing techniques.
